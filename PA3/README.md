Goal
------
Implement a [**Chord**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(peer-to-peer)) based [**Distributed HashTable**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table) functionality on Android devices. Although the design is based on Chord, it is a **simplified version of Chord** i.e we do not need to implement finger tables and finger-based routing; we also do not need to handle node leaves/failures.

There are three things that have to be implemented: - 
```
1. ID space partitioning/re-partitioning
2. Ring-based routing
3. Node joins
```

**NOTE**
if there are multiple instances of the app, all instances should form a **Chord ring** and serve insert/query requests in a distributed fashion according to the Chord protocol

Writing the Content Provider
-----------------------------------------
This project implements a [**Content Provider**](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-providers.html) that provide all the DHT functionalities. For example, it creates server and client threads, open sockets, and respond to incoming requests based on **Chord routing protocol**. There are few assumptions/restrictions for the [**Grader**] that test this application. Refer [**Project Specifications**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/154pUC7gd714noxwmuITNJztqQBYj5IimjaqzSgFTR3s/edit) for details: -

> 1. Any app (not just our app) should be able to access (read and write) our content provider.
> 2. The content provider should **only store the < key, value > pairs local to its own partition**.
> 3. The content provider do **not need to handle concurrent node joins** and its assumed that a node join will only happen once the system completely processes the previous join.
> 4. The content provider also do **not need to handle insert/query requests while a node is joining** and its assumed  that insert/query requests will be issued only with a stable system i.e there will be **no failure** in the system.
> 5. Each content provider instance should have a node id derived from its emulator port. This node id should be obtained by applying the SHA1 hash function to the emulator port. For example, **the node id of the content provider instance running on emulator-5554 should be, node_id = genHash(“5554”)**. This is necessary to find the correct position of each node in the Chord ring.
> 6. There are always **5 nodes** in the system.
> 7. We have fixed the ports & sockets: -</br>
	a) Our app opens one server socket that listens on **Port 10000**. </br>
	b) We use [**run_avd.py**] and [**set_redir.py**] scripts to set up the testing environment.</br>
	c) The grading will use 5 AVDs. The redirection ports are **11108, 11112, 11116, 11120, and 11124**.



Running the Grader/Testing Program
-----------------------------------------
> 1. Load the Project in Android Studio and create the [**apk file**](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/index.html).
> 2. Download  the [**Testing Program**] for your platform.
> 3. Before you run the program, please make sure that you are **running five AVDs**. The below command will do it: -
	- **python [run_avd.py] 5**
> 4. Also make sure that the **Emulator Networking** setup is done. The below command will do it: -
	- **python [set_redir.py] 10000**
> 5.  Run the grader: -
	- $ chmod +x ***< grader executable>***
	- $ ./*< grader executable>* ***apk file path***
> 6. **‘-h’** argument will show you what options are available. Usage is shown below: -
	-  $ *< grader executable>*  **-h**
